## Problem Statement
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
To create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet and host it on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## The Map

This is the map with all my favourite places in my home town. These were the places I visited when I was a child. Now I take my son to these places. Hope you will enjoy this.  
  
```{R}  
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("diamonds")
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
mycolors = c('red','blue','green','brown','cyan')
#plot_ly(d,x = ~cut)
#plot_ly(d, y = ~price, x = ~carat,color = ~factor(cut), size = ~carat,colors = mycolors, text = ~paste("Price: ", price, '$<br>Cut:', cut))

plot_ly(d, y = ~price, x = ~carat,color = ~factor(cut), 
        colors = mycolors, 
        text = ~paste("Price: ", price, '$<br>Cut:', cut)
        ,mode = 'markers',marker = list(size = ~carat*5, opacity = 0.5)
        )
```

```{R}
data("mtcars")
d <- mtcars
mycolors = c('red','blue')
#d <- rename(d, c("0" = "Automatic", "1" = "Manual"))
plot_ly(d,y = ~mpg,x = ~wt, color = ~factor(am),
        text = ~paste("Cylinder: ",cyl),
        colors = 'Paired', mode = 'markers',marker = list(size = ~cyl*3, opacity = 0.5))
