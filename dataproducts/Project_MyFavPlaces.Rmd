## Problem Statement
To create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet and host it on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## The Map

This is the map with all my favourite places in my home town. These were the places I visited when I was a child. Now I take my son to these places. Hope you will enjoy this.  
  
  
  
```{R echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

df<-data.frame(latitude=lats, longitude=longs, places=places, placecolor=c("blue","red","brown","green","black","violet","pink") )
```

```{R }
df %>% 
    leaflet() %>% 
    addTiles() %>%
    addCircleMarkers(lat=df$latitude, lng=df$longitude, color=df$placecolor, popup = df$places) %>% 
    addLegend(labels = df$places, colors=df$placecolor)
